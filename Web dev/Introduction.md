This document will be a summary of all web development technology that I have learned from HTML, CSS and JS to backend technologies, PHP, SQL, Node and many more technologies linked to web development. My goal for this document is to serve as both a way for me to better understand the technologies I am working with every day and a way for anyone who comes across this to gain better understanding of the web.

This document will be structured in a tree style structure, with broader titles nested with more in depth analysis. Of course, due to the complexity and broad ranging applications of the principles of web development, the progression of this summary will not be linear, but I will make it a high priority to list key pieces of information that a reader should have to understand the explanation.
