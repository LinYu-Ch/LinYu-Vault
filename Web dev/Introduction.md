This document will be an in depth analysis of all web development technology that I have learned from HTML, CSS and JS to backend technologies, PHP, SQL, Node and many more technologies linked to web development. My goal for this document is to serve as both a way for me to better understand the technologies I am working with every day and a way for anyone who comes across this to gain better understanding of the web.
