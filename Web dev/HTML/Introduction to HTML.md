HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, it is the technology that creates the structure of web pages. One can think of HTML as the skeleton of  a website.

It is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides a structured format for organizing content on the internet by using various tags and elements to define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML documents are comprised of a series of nested elements, each with its own purpose and properties, which are interpreted by web browsers to render the content visually. HTML also allows for the inclusion of other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it a fundamental building block for creating dynamic and visually appealing websites and web applications.
